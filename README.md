# Chitter
The aim of this project is to write a small twitter clone that will allow users  to post messages to a public stream.
It should have the following functionality -
- You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
- Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
- The username and email are unique.
- Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
- Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

### How to use
- Clone this repo to your machine
- Run bundle install
- Run rackup
- Visit localhost:[port number]
